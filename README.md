#Bike Sales Data Analysis

This project demonstrates my proficiency in SQL for data analysis, using a relational database of a bike store to answer key business questions. The analysis focuses on deriving actionable insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends to support data-driven decision-making.

This analysis provides a comprehensive view of the business through the following areas:

a)Sales and Revenue Performance:


   1)Total Revenue: Calculated the total revenue to understand overall business health.

   2)Monthly Trends: Analyzed total sales per month to identify seasonal patterns and performance over time.

b)Customer Insights


   1)Top Customers: Identified the top 10 customers by total spend to inform customer retention and loyalty programs.

   2)Customer Retention: Quantified the number of repeat customers to gauge customer loyalty.

   3)Average Order Value: Calculated the average order value per customer to understand purchasing habits.

c)Product & Store Analysis


   1)Top-Selling Products: Found the top 5 products by revenue to inform inventory and marketing strategies.

   2)Category Performance: Determined which product categories contribute the most to revenue.

   3)Store & Staff Performance: Compared revenue across different store locations and identified top-performing salespeople.
